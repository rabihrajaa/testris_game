## 📖 Introduction
This project, titled **Tetriste**, is a mini-game developed as part of the **Data Structures** course for the academic year 2023/2024. The game is designed to challenge players to create repeated patterns using colored and shaped pieces. The project was developed using **C++** and incorporates advanced data structures such as linked lists to manage game pieces and their interactions.

The game features user authentication, a dynamic game board, and various functionalities such as piece insertion, shifting, and chaining. The project also includes a scoring system, saving/loading game states, and a leaderboard for top scores.
